- Transaction support for purchases

### Component Structure
```
Frontend Components:
├── App.js (Main application)
├── AuthContext.js (Authentication state)
├── Navbar.js (Navigation)
├── Login.js & Register.js (Authentication)
├── EventsList.js (Event discovery)
├── SeatMap.js (Interactive seating)
└── PurchaseHistory.js (User tickets)

Backend Structure:

- Includes title, description, date, and custom SVG images

**Seats Table**
- Complete seating layout with 25 rows (A-Y)
- X,Y coordinates for visual positioning
- Dynamic pricing based on distance from stage

**Purchases Table**
- Transaction history linking users to seats and events
- Price captured at time of purchase
- Complete audit trail

## API DESIGN

### RESTful Endpoints

**Authentication**
- `POST /api/register` - Create new user account
- `POST /api/login` - Authenticate user

**Events**
- `GET /api/events` - List all available events
- `GET /api/events/:id` - Get specific event details

**Seating**
- `GET /api/events/:eventId/seats` - Get seat availability

**Purchases**
- `POST /api/purchase` - Purchase selected seat (protected)
- `GET /api/purchases` - Get user purchase history (protected)

### Security Features
- **JWT Authentication**: 24-hour token expiration
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds
- **Input Validation**: Server-side data validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Appropriate origin restrictions
